A plan lives in the body of the issue that it serves, not in a repository file. Put the
decisions, the steps, and a task list there, and edit the body with
`gh issue edit <number> --body-file <file>` when the plan changes. Use a comment only to
record why a plan changed. If the work has no issue, create one for it.
